This is important due to the legacy package being used by a lot of mods,
meaning that most if not all modules are "loaded" by default.

Most of them only do things when they are used by other mods,
but some modules due to timing issues, performance reasons and back compat have to act as soon as they can without having to scan other assemblies.

List of modules that do specific things as soon as they are loaded:

ContentManagementPlugin: Content provider subscription.

R2API Core: Bunch of things.

DifficultyPlugin: public fields are accessed by mods, no way of lazy init without expansive search / breaking change

DirectorPlugin: The hooks have to be enabled before a run start even though the mods may only use it after,
this is due to timing issues and making sure we have the original game data before other mods may modify it,
something we can't guarantee.

ElitesPlugin: Elite ramp.

LanguagePlugin: Scans the plugin folder for language files.

NetworkingPlugin: Compat mod list.
Note: Make sure to not enable the networking api hooks if no one use them,
we don't want to modify the network stack for nothing,
same thing goes for DamageTypeAPI and others which may interact with it.

SoundPlugin: Scans the plugin folder for audio bank files.
