# R2API.Stages - Easy Registration of Stages and Stage Variants + Stage Utils

## About

R2API.Stages is a submodule for R2API that adds a single unified method to register both new stages and variants of stages. 

R2API.Stages also hosts an abundant amount of utils to assist in stage making.

## Use Cases / Features

You can use `StageRegistration.RegisterSceneDefToNormalProgression` quickly register a SceneDef to its proper place in the normal progression. This method can add both variants and new custom stages. To add a variant, make sure the `baseSceneNameOverride` in your SceneDef is set to the same string as the stage you want to make a variant of. It also has extra parameters to control if the stage is pre-loop and post-loop.

The StageRegistration class also hosts `stageVariantDictionary`, which is a readonly dictionary to grab all the variants of a stage by inputting the `baseSceneNameOverride`. For example, if you input "golemplains" you will get a list of SceneDefs with atleast `golemplains` and `golemplains2`.
