[![Build Status](https://raegous.visualstudio.com/Risk%20of%20Rain%202%20Modding/_apis/build/status/Risk%20of%20Rain%202%20Modding-.NET%20Desktop-CI?branchName=master)](https://raegous.visualstudio.com/Risk%20of%20Rain%202%20Modding/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)


## About

R2API is a modding framework for other mods to work in, providing centralized and simplified APIs for Risk of Rain 2. This helps keeping mods compatible with each other.

At it's core, R2API should not change how the game behaves without any other mod installed. The only change is to keep mods out of quickplay and prismatic trials by request of the **Hopoo Games** team. 

## Installation

The contents of `R2API` should be extracted into the `BepInEx` folder, such that the files inside the `monomod` folder in the zip sit in the `monomod` folder in BepInEx and the files and folder in `plugins` in the archive is inside your `plugins` folder.

A succesful installation should look like this:

A lot of documentation is in the included *xmldocs*, and further information may be on the dedicated [R2API wiki](https://github.com/risk-of-thunder/R2API/wiki). Do not hestiate to ask in [the modding discord](https://discord.gg/5MbXZvd) too!
