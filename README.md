## RoR2 1.0 - IMPORTANT NOTICE

In the Release version of RoR2, Hopoo Games made a `NetworkModCompatibilityHelper` class, which can be given a mod list that is then transformed into a hash that will be checked upon client connection in multiplayer.
If the hash doesnt correspond between the server and the connecting client, the connection is refused.

R2API will add mods to that mod list if they:

* Use the `NetworkCompatibility` Attribute, either as an custom assembly attribute, or at the top of their plugin class inheriting from `BaseUnityPlugin` with the first argument being `CompatibilityLevel.EveryoneMustHaveMod`.
* Don't have the `NetworkCompatibility` Attribute or the `ManualNetworkRegistrationAttribute` anywhere in their assembly.

## About

R2API is a modding framework for other mods to work in, providing centralized and simplified APIs for Risk of Rain 2. This helps keeping mods compatible with each other.

At it's core, R2API should not change how the game behaves without any other mod installed. The only change is to keep mods out of quickplay and prismatic trials by request of the **Hopoo Games** team. 

## Installation

The contents of `R2API` should be extracted into the `BepInEx` folder, such that the files inside the `monomod` folder in the zip sit in the `monomod` folder in BepInEx and the files and folder in `plugins` in the archive is inside your `plugins` folder.

A succesful installation should look like this:
