## RoR2 1.0 - IMPORTANT NOTICE

In the Release version of RoR2, Hopoo Games made a `NetworkModCompatibilityHelper` class, which can be given a mod list that is then transformed into a hash that will be checked upon client connection in multiplayer.
If the hash doesnt correspond between the server and the connecting client, the connection is refused.

R2API will add mods to that mod list if they:

* Use the `NetworkCompatibility` Attribute, either as an custom assembly attribute, or at the top of their plugin class inheriting from `BaseUnityPlugin` with the first argument being `CompatibilityLevel.EveryoneMustHaveMod`.
* Don't have the `NetworkCompatibility` Attribute but depend on R2API (have `[BepInDependency("com.bepis.r2api")]` attribute).

## About

R2API is a modding framework for other mods to work in, providing centralized and simplified APIs for Risk of Rain 2. This helps keeping mods compatible with each other.

At it's core, R2API should not change how the game behaves without any other mod installed. The only change is to keep mods out of quickplay and prismatic trials by request of the **Hopoo Games** team. 

## Manual installation

The contents of `R2API` should be extracted into the `BepInEx` folder, such that the files inside the `plugins` folder in the zip sit in the `plugins` folder in BepInEx.

Also you need to install [HookGenPatcher](https://thunderstore.io/package/RiskofThunder/HookGenPatcher/) because R2API wont function without it.

## Developing

A lot of documentation is in the included *xmldocs*, and further information may be on the dedicated [R2API wiki](https://github.com/risk-of-thunder/R2API/wiki). Do not hestiate to ask in [the modding discord](https://discord.gg/5MbXZvd) too!
